### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.

# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.:
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc.

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer.

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False

# 'double equals' required on if statement
# 'else' requires a colon



  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2

# 'def' rather than 'dif'
# missing comma between card1 & card2
# 'if' statement is not indented
# if both cards have same value, card2 will be returned 
# no card variable within the function



def cards_total(self, cards):
  
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total

# function is not indented to sit within the class
# 'total' variable should be assigned a value 
# attemtping to add an int to a string - 'total' needs to be a string
# formatting after return string - include a space before the total
# incorrect indentation on return statement 

```
